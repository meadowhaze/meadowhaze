Skyline started out as a HTML template that I designed and developed as a product. It was the 3rd HTML template to be sold on the Themeforest marketplace.

## Technology

It was build using AssembleJS, not to be confused with the assemble language. AssembleJS is a un known gem, it's similar to Jekyll which is more well known - but that doesn't equal better. For my use case it was perfect.

It uses on Node, Yeoman, YAML, Grunt and handlebars. It's a fantasic little framework for static site builds - fast and quick to build with.

## Awwwards & Mentions



I was very pleased to have the HTML version of Skyline win a user approved award on [awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/skyline-1).

Themes often don't do that well on Awwwards sites as they need to be fairly generic to appeal to a wide audience. I tried to hit a balance with Skyline, to be generic enough to be used for a varity of uses, but creative enough to stand out.

Later the project was converted to WordPress and this was featured on [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/skyline).

## And Now

This was also sold on Themeforest initially. However I removed it from sale from there in preference of selling via creative market and my own site so I could how my business in ways that was impossible on Themeforest. The theme is still being updating as it's currently still powering many sites.
