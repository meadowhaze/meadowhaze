I worked together with designer Jeff Immer at Biklops to create the website for Equip, an Atlasssian certified Consultancy. Based on Jeffâ€™s design, I created a custom WordPress theme for the site. This used my Zorbix Framework and page builder.

The theme had custom page types and options that allowed the client to control the site themselves. It was designed to be clean and easy to natigate with only relevant options to the client. This is something you only get with a custom theme and is one of the benefits of going bespoke.

Stock themes have options for everyone and very often so many that it really gets in the way of your site management wasting your time.

Things like the footer widgets where adjustable by the user via the live customizer
