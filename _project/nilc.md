The client originally approached me for to create a custom solution to sell courses using WooCommerce as no existing solutions existed. But we decided to extend Event Espresso instead to provided the custom features needed.

This was a really good option because Event Espresso is very feature rich as itâ€™s been on the market for a long time. Their support is also top notch. By using Even Espresso the client ended up with much more control over the site then they would have had with a custom solution based on WooCommerce.

I created the Events part of the website, including custom templates.
